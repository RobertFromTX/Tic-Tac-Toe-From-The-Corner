# Tic-Tac-Toe-From-The-Corner
This program simulates a tic-tac-toe game between two bots. The bots prioritize winning if there are two of their tokens in a row. Then, they prioritize blocking if there are two of the opponent tokens in a row. 

The program was built in an attempt to calculate the best starting position in tic-tac-toe. The bots automatically win or block in order to simulate 2 humans who are completely aware but have no knowledge of strategies as they place the tokens randomly when there is no need for a win or block.


This program was built in 2020 in my junior year of high school for a math class to calculate experimental probabilities.

Legend for the boards:
0 = Empty Space
1 = Player 1(X)
2 = Player 2(O)
